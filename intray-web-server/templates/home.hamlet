    is to systematically write them down? Try it out with intray!
  <p>
    Intray offers a no-nonsense web interface to write down your
    thoughts and ideas anywhere you go, and easily process them.
    It is faster, cleaner and leaner than any of its alternatives,
    while exposing an elegant API and including a CLI and an android app.

            Why can I not modify items?
        <div .description>
          <p>
            Items represent thoughts you have and want to get out of your head.
            The purpose is to not think about the ideas anymore between when you write them down and when you process them.
            During processing, you take the items out of the intray and think about what you want to do with each idea.
            After that, you delete the item from the intray.
            Allowing to modify items would only allow you to make yourself less efficient.

            Why can I not list all my items?
        <div .description>
          <p>
            Only being able to view one item at a time forces you to process items one by one without skipping any.
            This is a proven improvement to your processing speed.

            So it's a todo list?
        <div .description>
          <p>
            No. It is like a box which contains arbitrary thoughts you want to get out of your head.
            These thoughts still require processing, as opposed to todo items.

            Yes, intray is free software, so anyone can host an Intray server themselves.

            How is Intray better than the notes application on my phone?
        <div .description>
          <p>
            Notes and intray Items serve a fundamentally different purpose.
            Intray items are meant to be short term, ephemeral and for prosessing.
            Notes have an indeterminate life-time and do not lend themselves well to processing.
            Intray incorporates the best-practices for processing and is not cluttered by unnecessary features.

            Moreover, Intray items will persist beyond eventual damage to your phone.
            This is not the case for all notes apps.

        <div .description>
          <p>
            Intray has been designed with your ease of mind and efficiency in mind.
            For example, the processing does not allow you to see more than one item at a time,
            which is a proven strategy to improve your processing efficiency.

              Intray allows for more efficient processing.
          <div .item>
            <p>
              Intray allows you to use a web interface, e.g. through your phone,
              as well as a command line interface. This combination makes intray
              more efficient to use.
